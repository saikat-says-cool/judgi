---

## üí¨ Research Chat Interface

The Research Chat is your conversational AI partner for legal inquiries. Ask questions, get structured answers, and save key findings directly to your Canvas.

### Asking Questions

*   Simply type your legal question or query into the input field at the bottom of the chat.
*   Press \`Enter\` or click the \`Send\` button (paper airplane icon) to submit your query.

### Research Modes: Tailor Your AI's Depth

Before sending a message, you can select a research mode to control how deeply JudgiAI searches for information.

*   **No Research**:
    *   **Purpose**: For quick, general knowledge questions or when you want the AI to rely solely on its pre-trained knowledge.
    *   **When to Use**: Ideal for definitions, basic explanations, or brainstorming without needing external data.
*   **Moderate Research**:
    *   **Purpose**: The AI will perform a focused search, fetching up to **10 relevant legal documents** to inform its response.
    *   **When to Use**: Suitable for initial case exploration, understanding specific legal concepts with supporting precedents, or when you need a balanced overview.
*   **Deep Research**:
    *   **Purpose**: The AI conducts an extensive search, retrieving up to **20 legal documents** and **10 current news articles** to provide a comprehensive answer.
    *   **When to Use**: Essential for in-depth analysis, complex legal problems requiring broad context, or when current events might influence legal interpretation.

### AI Model Modes: Control AI's Thinking Process

Independently of research depth, you can choose how the AI processes your request.

*   **Auto**:
    *   **Purpose**: The standard, efficient AI model (`LongCat-Flash-Chat`) for quick and direct responses.
    *   **When to Use**: Most everyday queries, general information, or when speed is a priority.
*   **Deep Think**:
    *   **Purpose**: Activates a more analytical AI model (`LongCat-Flash-Thinking`) with an enhanced "thinking budget." This allows the AI to perform more complex reasoning and provide more detailed, nuanced responses.
    *   **When to Use**: For intricate legal problems, strategic advice, or when you need the AI to delve deeper into logical connections and implications.

### Interpreting AI Responses

*   **Structured Summaries**: AI responses are formatted for clarity, often including summaries of cases, statutes, or legal principles.
*   **Citations**: JudgiAI diligently includes citations for legal research results. These will appear as **Markdown links** (e.g., \`[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1551775/)\`). Click on these links to open the source document in a new tab for verification and deeper reading.
*   **Loading Indicators**: While JudgiAI is processing, you'll see a spinning square icon and detailed status messages (e.g., "Searching legal documents...", "Generating AI response...") to keep you informed.

### Voice Input

*   **Start Recording**: If the input field is empty, a microphone icon will appear. Click it to start recording your query.
*   **Audio Level Feedback**: A pulsating microphone icon provides visual feedback on your audio input level.
*   **Send/Cancel**: Click the \`Check\` icon to send your recorded message for transcription and AI processing, or the \`X\` icon to cancel the recording.
*   **Transcription Status**: A "Transcribing audio..." message will appear while your speech is being converted to text.

### Saving to Canvas

*   After an AI response, a \`Save to Canvas\` button (floppy disk icon) will appear below the message.
*   Clicking this button will open a dialog:
    *   **Select Existing Document**: Choose one of your existing documents from the list to append the AI's response to it.
    *   **Create New Document**: Enter a new title to create a brand new document in your Canvas, and the AI's response will be its initial content.
*   Click \`Save\` to complete the action.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Copilot Canvas (AI Writing Space)

The Copilot Canvas is your dedicated environment for drafting legal documents with live AI assistance.

### Creating or Opening Documents

*   **From Canvas Home**: Navigate to the "Canvas" tab in the sidebar. Here, you can:
    *   Click \`Create New Canvas\` to start a fresh document.
    *   Select any of your "Recent Canvases" to continue working on an existing document.
*   **From Chat**: Use the "Save to Canvas" feature in the Research Chat to create a new document or append to an existing one.

### Rich Text Editor

The left panel of the Canvas is your rich text editor, powered by TipTap. It supports comprehensive formatting without needing to switch modes.

*   **Basic Formatting**:

    *   **Blockquote**: \`Quote\` icon.
*   **Text Alignment**:
    *   Align Left, Center, Right, Justify icons.
*   **Undo/Redo**: \`Undo\` and \`Redo\` icons for quick revisions.
*   **Highlight**: \`Highlight\` icon to apply text highlighting.
*   **Note**: Font family selection has been removed to maintain a consistent aesthetic.

### AI Assistant Chat (within Canvas)

The right panel is your dedicated AI Assistant, providing contextual help based on your document content.

*   **Asking Questions**: Type your questions or commands into the input field. The AI will use the content of your document as context.
*   **Drafting Actions**: Use the \`Drafting Actions\` dropdown for common legal drafting tasks:
    *   **Summarize Document**: Get a concise summary of your current document.
    *   **Draft as Petition**: Reformat your content into a legal petition structure.
    *   **Improve Legal Language**: Enhance the clarity and professionalism of your writing.
    *   **Expand Last Section**: Get the AI to elaborate on the most recent section of your document.
    *   **Suggest Next Argument**: Receive AI suggestions for logical next steps or arguments.
    *   **Suggest Precedents for Document**: Obtain relevant legal precedents with citations based on your content.
    *   **Generate Footnotes/Citations**: Ask the AI to review and add appropriate footnotes or citations directly into your document.

### AI Document Updates: How the AI Modifies Your Document

The AI Assistant can directly modify your document using special tags. You'll see a conversational message in the chat explaining what the AI has done.

*   **Replacing Content (\`<DOCUMENT_REPLACE>\`)**:
    *   **Action**: The AI will completely overwrite the entire content of your document with its new output.
    *   **When Used**: For major restructuring, polishing, significant edits, or when the AI needs to start fresh based on your command.
*   **Appending Content (\`<DOCUMENT_WRITE>\`)**:
    *   **Action**: The AI will add its new output to the very end of your existing document.
    *   **When Used**: For adding new sections, arguments, or continuations.
*   **AI Writing Indicator**: While the AI is actively modifying your document, a message like "JudgiAI is appending..." or "JudgiAI is replacing document content..." will appear at the bottom of the writing canvas, providing clear feedback.

### Document Management

*   **Document Title**: Edit the document title directly in the input field at the top of the editor.
*   **Auto-Save**: Your document content and AI chat history are automatically saved every 5 seconds when changes are detected.
*   **Manual Save**: Click the \`Save\` icon (floppy disk) at the top to manually save your changes at any time.
